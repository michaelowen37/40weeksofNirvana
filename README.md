Book about happiness
An unconventional, evidence-based novel designed to be read over the course of a year. 52 weeks in a year, 52 exercises in the book. Each chapter, only a page in length, represents a new skill to be learned and developed over the course of a week.
The goal is to encourage readers to practice, reflect and tweak each exercise at a pace that allows conscious thinking to transition into subconscious habit. Otherwise, it's just too easy to fall back into old habits.
By combining information from psychiatrists, researchers, therapists and even monks, you will be equipped with the tools necessary to navigate your own personal struggles quickly and efficiently while simaltaneously maximizing your time spent being happy!
