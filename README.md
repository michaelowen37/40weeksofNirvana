# 40 Weeks of Nirvana
A one-of-a-kind book that helps you find happiness through growth.
We'll cover how to grow mentally, physically, socially, spiritually, professionally, healthily and more.
Each chapter, only a page in length, represents a new, evidence-based skill to be learned and developed over the course of a week.
Through a bit of careful planning, practice and reflection, these conscious-level concepts develop into meaningful, subconscious habits potentially benefiting you for life.
The research, sourced from psychiatrists, therapists, monks and more ensures that there is something for everyone. Best of all, it's practical, relatable and easily-digestible.
You'll gain persectives that will impact all areas of your life. As a result, you can expect stronger relationships, improved confidence and a greater sense of self-compassion, discipline, community and more.
We'll brush on the science behind the “why” then, over the course of a week, discover various ways of incorporating the “how.”
