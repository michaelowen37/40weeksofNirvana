    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">AUTHOR BIO:</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>
        I was going to write a third-person biography about myself but thought that was kind of weird.  So here we go, an autobiography.  My name is Michael and I'm an average guy currently living in Austin.  I'm in a few run groups around town, I love learning new things and I also enjoy creative projects.  My wife, Savanah, is amazing. I'm dumbfounded as to how I was able to pull that one off but grateful to have somebody who cares about my well-being as much as she does.  My son Jaxon, 2 years old at the time of this writing, is also incredible.  He keeps us on our toes and helps me fulfill my "learning new things" cravings.  I try to always spend as much of my time as I can with him.  During the day, I'm a cardiac sonographer, husband and father.  At night, when everyone goes to sleep, is when I slip away and start working on my creative projects (including this one).  That's how I fulfill my creativity cravings.  In fact, Savanah is asleep next to me right now!  Life is great now but getting to this point was far from pretty.<br><br>

        Not too long ago, it wasn't uncommon for me to be crippled with anxiety and depression on any given night.  I struggled making sense of these unrelenting feelings and always felt that I should be happier as I was fairly successful and had some noteable accomplishments under my belt.  Sure, my childhood wasn't great, whose is?  I felt neglected and abused both mentally and physically but I had overcome all of that.  It was a thing of the past and I refused to let it have any effect on my future.  Little did I know, as a naive young adult in my 20s and early 30s, most of my negative feelings and behaviors were DIRECTLY attributed to my childhood environment.  Many of those years were spent in solitude.  My father was on the road as a truck driver and my step mother loved to ground me for any little thing.  If I wasn't grounded, I was forced to stay outside or even leave the property altogether so that I could "make new friends."  There's a lot that I'm going to purposely leave out.  <br><br>

        The important thing to me was that my situation was dire and there were zero indications of it improving in the future.  I had to get out of it so when I was 16 years old, I decided to wait for my step-mother to leave the house for work and I ran away.  Ever since that day, I never looked back. At first, it was very difficult, I was fortunate enough to have a step aunt nearby and she took me in until I ruined the relationship (at the time).  After that, I found myself couch surfing amongst friends until I eventually managed to graduate high school.  I maintained a full-time, minimum wage job during my junior and senior years and I was often seen sprinting to work after school.   If I couldn't find a ride, the sprinting was necessary to make it on time.  Eventually, I accumulated enough to purchase a problem-infested car and prepaid cell phone.  It felt good being mostly independent at such a young age.  I'll never forget graduation day though, it really hurt my feelings not having people to celebrate my successes with.  So I found a way to slip away during the height of the celebrations.<br><br>

        My biological mother and brother were kept secret until I was around 16 (perfect timing I know).  It was an opportunity during a time I was in need and it felt good having loving family suddenly appear in my life.  Of course I picked up my things and moved to San Antonio with my biological mother and brother whom I knew nothing about.  I'm so very grateful my brother Chris was able to find me and get this entire process initiated.  Of course I eventually ruined my relationship with my mother and found myself on the streets of San Antonio.  I remember the empty parking lots I had to sleep in, storing non-perishables in the trunk of my car and purchasing a gym membership just to kill time, take showers and brush my teeth.  These were immensely stressful and scary times for me yet I still tried to stay strong and find ways of pulling myself out of the situation.  I was yet to connect my behaviors to my childhood, probably because I was always focused on the future.  What's bizarre to me is that I don't remember most of my childhood.  There's like two or three memories as a child that I can think of but the rest takes place during my pre-teen years into highschool.  I assume that it's just my brain's way of protecting me from bad memories that are irrelevant and serve no purpose. <br><br> 


        Savanah eventually inspired me to go back to college and stick with it.  Prior to that, I was taking classes here and there but the homelessness and less-than-ideal financial situation really put a damper on things.  I think it took nearly a decade just to get my associate's degree.  Surprisingly though, my toxic competitiveness was actually beneficial for me during these times.  Every test was a competition and my ego was always on the line.  It led me to maintain A+ averages even in physics, calculus, cellular and molecular biology and cardiac sonography.  After graduating ultrasound school, the professors casually mentioned to me that they had initially ranked me as the least likely to succeed out of the entire class.  Their program accepts only about 15 students and they reliably lose over half of them before graduation.  If you can make it through the Austin program, you're guaranteed to ace your boards.  Regardless, that A, which I'm still extremely proud of, was only accomplished one other time in Austin's cardiac sonography program.  I was by a student who attended a decade before I did and she already had some ultrasound experience going in.  I blame this mostly on the toxic competitiveness.  It was the only way I could prove my value.  So yes, it did some good for me but it was also good at ruining many of my days and at times, relationships.<br><br>


        In 2017, after graduating with my associate's degree, I had an opportunity to speak in front of nearly 700 professionals in the field of echocardiography.  I was even trained by the the official TedMed coach!  I had come up with a software solution that could greatly impact the field and my professor encouraged me to share it on a grand scale.  Everybody in the audience was way smarter than me and it all felt so unreal.  Talk about imposter syndrome.  So things were seemingly going great at this point in my life.  I accomplished quite a bit and I was earning a salary I had only dreamed of previously yet couldn't escape the unhappiness.  I simply couldn't understand why I always felt so depressed and why my relationships continued to suffer.  It wasn't uncommon for me to ask myself a question I couldn't answer, "What's wrong with me?"  <br><br>

        What I wasn't paying attention was how these accomplishments were feeding my already inflated ego, how toxically competitive I had become over the years and why I was incapable of communicating effectively or practicing emotional intelligence. None of that stuff was ever taught to me as a kid.  My value was intimately connected to my accomplishments (or so I thought) and trusting people was completely off the table.  On top of that, I was a people pleaser and never stood up for myself.  This oftentimes resulted in me sacrificing my own happiness for the happiness of others.  How Savanah was able to endure all of this is a surprise to me.  If and when I won at something, I was sure to rub it in.  If I lost, I pouted.  If you said the wrong thing to me, regardless of how established our relationship was, I would still leave in a heart beat.  Empathy was non-existent and many friends were lost along the way.  Worst of all, I almost lost my best friend Savanah. <br><br>


        Without ever learning about emotional intelligence or how to effectively listen and communicate with others, it was no surprise that my marriage with Savanah was rocky.  Even on our wedding night we had gotten into a fight.  I was constantly sabotaging our relationship when things were going too smoothly and at times, it had escalated to levels I'm not proud of.  Now, after many years of struggle and near losses, I'm happy to announce that our relationship is stronger than ever.  The things I've learned before and during the creation of this book literally saved us.  We fell back in love with the newest versions of ourselves and I learned how to co-exist and thrive as a couple through productive conversations, real empathy and emotional connection.  I've never been able to establish this kind of connection with anybody else.  Needless to say, I'll do anything to keep Savanah in my life at this point even if that wasn't always the case. <br><br>


        I went from burning bridges to establishing real connections.  I learned how to become more self-aware and take control over how I feel.  While writing this book, I continued to learn and practice the things I was preaching and it even led to a reconnection with my mother!  I hadn't talked to her in over three years then all of a sudden, she was visiting my house in Austin and meeting her grandson for the first time!  That relationship was thought to be completely unsalvagable after the intense fights that we had with each other.  Very mean things were verbalized by both parties.  These exercises really work, I know first hand.  I've poured my heart into every single page and managed to intertwine fact-based data in a conversational and relatable way.  Don't worry, it's not about me, my main focus is on the actual concepts and the science behind them.  However, every chapter has a special place in my own personal journey towards happiness.  I've gone through the processes, learned how to fine-tune them and developed the skills necessary to turn my life around.  The first step was deciding that I wanted to be happier and that will be your first step too. <br><br> 


        Adjusting your mindset to prioritize happiness is a must, simply reading about it isn't enough.  You must prioritize it, reflect on it and work towards it on a daily basis.  Some days will undoubtedly be more difficult than others but having these tools at your fingertips will surely guide you in the right direction.  It's a mindset and I'll teach you how to develop it.<br><br>   


        As someone who loves to create and help others, it was only a matter of time before our paths would cross. <i>Dare to be Happy</i> is my most prized accomplishment to date and I appreciate you taking the time to read it.  As a first-time author, your support means a great deal.  Please share this guide with friends and family who might benefit and I hear that reviews are pretty crucial as well.  I look forward to hearing your story and seeing how this book has helped you!
