    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">AUTHOR BIO:</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>
        Michael is an average guy living in Austin, Texas who loves running, learning and creating new things.  He has a lovely wife named Savanah and an amazing son named Jaxon.  His day job consists of evaluating hearts with ultrasound but he loves taking on side-projects for fun as well.  However, family is his number one priority.  On the surface, from an outside perspective, things probably look picture-perfect.  However, for many years, this was far from the case.  <br><br>

        Michael was no stranger to perpetual depression and anxiety.  Although he tried connecting these feelings to whatever was happening in his life at the time, it turns out a large majority of it was directly influenced by his upbringing.  After what he considers years of childhood neglect and solitude, physical and emotional abuse and other unnecessary trauma, he eventually ran away from home at the age of 16.  This led to many years living in survival mode.  For awhile, he was fortunate enough to have friends and step-family help support him by allowing him to surf through their houses and finish highschool.  As a junior and senior he even managed to maintain a full-time job!  If he wasn't able to catch a ride after school, he would literally have to sprint to work with his backpack and a change of clothes to make it on time.  He did it though and eventually was able to afford his own vehicle, cell phone and clothing.  During this time he worked on building credit, progressing through jobs, making more money and eventually managed to put himself through college.  It took nearly a decade to get an associates degree as he had no financial support and even had to live in his car at times.  He remembers purchasing a gym membership to take showers, parking in secluded lots to sleep and keeping a supply of non-perishable food in the trunk to survive.  During sonography school, Michael had to maximize his student loans in order to maintain his bills and he even sold his car to get a fuel-efficient motorcycle with cheaper insurance just to save money.  He lived in approximately 11 households over the course of 10 years.  Despite all of these challenges, Michael was still able to excel in college and achieve A's in difficult classes such as physics, calculus, cellular and molecular biology and even cardiac sonography.  When the sonography program was over, the professors admitted that they had ranked him as the least likely to succeed yet he ended up being one of only two people who had ever achieved an A in the program.  The other person attended the school 10 years prior and already had ultrasound experience.  In 2017, after graduation, he had an opportunity to be trained by the the official TedMed coach (at the time) and present a software solution he had created at the annual scientific sessions hosted by the American Society of Echocardiography.  There were nearly 700 people in the audience and most were much smarter than him.  He reached a level of success he never though possible yet he still felt unhappy.  These surpressed emotions continued to haunt him over the years until he eventually found himself hitting rock bottom.  The events that occured at this point of his life led to the creation of this book.  <br><br>
        Without being taught emotional intelligence or how to effectively communicate with people as a kid, it was no surprise that Michael's marriage with Savanah was rocky.  He was willing to cut the relationship off several times throughout the marriage and if it wasn't for Savanah's persistence and patience, it wouldn't have lasted.  She taught him the importance of effective communication and empathy.  He lost several friendships along the way and even got to the point of considering how the world might be without him.  Savanah was the only person in his corner during these darkest moments yet he didn't appreciate it.  This was largely attributed to the toxic behaviors he had developed as a child which ranged from an inflated ego, toxic competitiveness, and lack of empathy for others to an inability to trust, a quickness to cut relationships and a poor understanding of emotional intelligence and effective communication.  Eventually all of his bridges were burned.  After consulting with a therapist and practicing some deep reflection, he able to make the connections between his behavior and his childhood environment.  He learned that he had the power to control his own trajectory and pull himself out of his chronic depression.  By the age of 33, he finally felt as though he had experienced true happiness and the feeling was absolutely phenominal.  There was no way we was going to keep this information to himself when he could potentially help others.  <br><br>  From there, Michael quickly set out to collect and organize as much information surrounding happiness as possible.  He practiced each concept, took notes and practiced some more.  It wasn't uncommon for him to stop on the side of the highway, pause a conversation or get up in the middle of the night to jot down notes as the ideas started flowing.  Eventually, he was able to break everything down into 52 easily digestable exercises and write them in a way that was relatable and conversational.  Each one was written from the heart as he combined his personal experiences with the research-backed data and he continues to practice each of them even to this day.  As someone who loves to create and help others, it was only a matter of time before <i>Dare to be Happy</i> came to fruition.
