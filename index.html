    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">AUTHOR BIO:</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>
        I'm an average guy living in Austin, Texas who loves running, learning and creating new things.  My wife, Savanah, is an amazing person and I'm extrememly lucky to have her in my life.  My son Jaxon is incredible too.  I'm a cardiac sonographer, father and husband during the day but at night, when everyone goes to bed, I love challenging myself with different kinds of creative projects.  Getting to this point, however, was not pretty.<br><br>

        In the not too distant past, it wasn't uncommon for me to be crippled with anxiety and depression.  I struggled making sense of it as I had felt like my life was fairly successful.  My childhood wasn't great as I felt neglected and abused both mentally and physically but I had overcome all of that.  In fact, I actively ignored my past and always focused on the future.  What I didn't realize though, was that many of my negative feelings and behaviors could be attributed to my childhood environment.  I lived many of my childhood years in solitude.  I was grounded a lot and when I wasn't, I was forced to stay outside or "make new friends."  There are other things that I'll leave out for now.  The important thing is that the situation never improved.  Eventually, when I was 16 years old, I decided to run away when my step-mother was working.  I never looked back. At first, it was very difficult, I was able to stay with my step-family for a while until I ruined the relationship and eventually I started a trend of couch surfing amongst friends.  Eventually, I managed to graduate high school and even bought a car and cell phone with my minimum wage salary.  I'll never forget graduation day though, it felt very lonely not having anyone show up.  My biological mother and brother were kept secret until I was around 16 (perfect timing I know) and it led me to pickup and move to San Antonio.  I'm very grateful my brother was able to find me.  Of course I ruined my relationship with my mother and found myself kicked out of the house and on the streets.  This is part of the reason the associate's took so long.  I remember finding empty parking lots to sleep in, keeping non-perishables in the back and purchasing a gym membership so that I could take showers and brush my teeth.  These were not fun times and I had still not made any connection between my dysfunctional behavior and my childhood. <br><br> 


        Thanks to Savanah, she inspired me to continue pursuing school.  My toxic competition was actually beneficial during this period.  Every test was a competition, I had to prove my value at all costs.  With that I maintained As in physics, calculus, cellular and molecular biology and lastly cardiac sonography.  After graduation, the professors actually casually mentioned that they initially ranked me as the most likely student to fail.  However, I was able to get an A (which I'm proud of obviously) and there was only one other student ever to achieve such a grade and it was 10 years prior.  It felt good because they ended up re-evaluating their program's acceptance processes.  <br><br>

        In 2017, after graduation, I had an opportunity to be trained by the the official TedMed coach.  I had come up with a software solution that could greatly impact the field in a positive way.  There were nearly 700 people in the audience and most were WAY smarter than me.  Talk about imposter syndrome.  So things were seemingly going great at this point in my life.  I accomplished quite a bit and it was the best salary I've every had yet I still felt unhappy.  I just couldn't understand why and my relationships continued to suffer.  The accomplishments were feeding my already inflated ego, I was so toxically competitive that entire days would be ruined if I ever lost and I had no idea what emotional intelligence or effective communication was.  It was simply never taught to me.  My value was attached to accomplishments and I unknowingly struggled with trust.  I was a people pleaser and never stood up for myself, often sacrificing my own happiness for the happiness of others.  I'm not really sure how Savanah tolerated these behaviors for so long but she did!  If and when I won at something, I was sure to rub it in.  If you said the wrong thing to me, even if our relationship was well established, I still didn't hesitate to end it.  Empathy was lacking and many friends were lost along the way.  Worst of all, I almost lost my best friend, Savanah. <br><br>

        Without ever learning about emotional intelligence or how to effectively communicate with other people, it was no surprise that my marriage with Savanah was rocky.  I had a habit of perpetually sabotaging our relationship when things were going too well and it at times, it had escalated to levels I'm not proud of.  Now, after almost losing her entirely, we are stronger than ever.  The things I've learned before and during the creation of this book literally saved us.  We fell back in love with the new versions of ourselves and learned how to thrive through productive conversations, real empathy and an emotional connection I never want to lose. <br><br>

        I went from burning bridges to establishing connections.  I learned how to become self-aware and take control of how I feel.  At the time of writing the book, as I was practicing what I was preaching, I even reconnected with my mother after 3 years of zero conversation.  I thought there was no way to salvage that relationship after the fights we had.  These exercises work, and I've poured my heart into this book.  Don't worry, it's not about me, my main focus is on the actual concepts and the science behind them.  But every chapter was written with my own personal experiences in mind.  I've gone through the process of learning and developing these skills and I continue to do so on a daily basis.  Deciding to be happy and striving for it is a great first step.  However, you're not finished once you experience it.  You have to make it a priority and some days will undoubtedly be more difficult than others.  It's a mindset and I'm going to provide you with the tools.<br><br>   

        As someone who loves to create and help others, it was only a matter of time before <i>Dare to be Happy</i>came to fruition.
